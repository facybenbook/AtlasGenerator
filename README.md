# AtlasGenerator
A texture atlas generator

This project is old and won't be updated in the future. It is open source from now on but I won't recommend to copy the cody due to some major design flaws I encountered much later.
Furthermore the code is a total mess without good commenting!

If you intend to use it or to base your shader on it - feel free to use it. No license whatsoever needed!
